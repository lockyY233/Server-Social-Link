    "- when everyone inside a voice call, leveling up is a time problem.\n",

    "- when someone leave vc with 1 or more people inside the vc before level up\n",
    "- level up when someone inside a vc\n",
    "\n",
    "keep those problems in mind, now we can start looking at the code structure:\n",
    "- conn_line object records all necessary information about each two pairs inside a voice call\n",
    "- whenever a person join a vc, create conn_line object and automatically start the timer between each two pair of person inside a vocie call(can be done by double for looping, can be seen in join_vc_handler() in SlinkBot.py)\n",
    "- the timer convert the xp each persona have into the time require to level up and run it through asyncio.sleep()\n",
    "- once the timer reached, triggers the level up, and restart the cycle\n",
    "- if the user leave before the timer is up, return the time.time() and subtract with the time when conn_line object created\n",
    "\n",

    "- the while loop can be turn off anytime\n",
    "- while loop and any other coroutine need to be running concurrently\n",

    "- two functions label under counter are solely for debug purposes. it helps you see how long the time has passed since the code run\n",
    "- global variable switch can break the while loop anytime\n",
    "- loop body contains the while loop and it will keep spawning loop_coro every 5 second. until the switch turned off\n",
    "- task.wait() inside the while loop means the while loop will not proceed until the task is finish\n",
    "- since it is possible to spawn task within spawn(), you can spawn two jobs running the while loop concurrently."
